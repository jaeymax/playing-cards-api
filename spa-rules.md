### Spa Game rules

## Spa is a Ghanaian or African variant of a card game.It is a trick taking game where players take turns with the goal of leading the current trick

# The game can consist of minimum of two players and maximum of 4 four players. Although in reality the game can consist of any number of players as long as there are enough cards for each player.

# Lets assume two players now for simplicity and for explanation purposes as the game rules stays the same regardless of the number of players.

# On game start the creator of the game or the one who shuffles and deals starts with the first turn.

# The cards are shuffled and shared to each player where each player gets a total of five cards only. less or more is not allowed.

# The cards are distributed in a 3, 3, 2, 2 order meaning the shuffler starts dealing by giving the opponent three cards and the next three to himself. then 2 of the rest are giving to the opponent and the rest 2 are giving to himself in that order. In the variant which consist of more the two players the same rules still applies where 3 cards are giving to all other players apart from the shuffler first in a circular order before himself. and the rest of the two cards for each player follows with the shuffler being the last to share to himself

# Now when game starts each player holds five cards as specified earlier

# The Dealer of the card is the first to take trick in the game

# The first card or player in the game is allowed to play the card of any suit as there are no leading suits and no cards played yet.

# The first card played in the game becomes the leading suit of the first trick

# The opponent then takes turn and is mandated to follow suit unless he does not have a card of the leading suit.

# in the situation where the opponent does not have the card of the leading suit he is allowed to play any other card

# in the case where the opponent does have a card of the leading suit he is allowed to play any card of the leading suit he may chose to play higher or a lower ranked one

# After each trick the player with the highest ranked card of the leading suits is term the leader. scores are not awared for individual tricks yet and is only awarded for the last and final trick.

# The goal of the game is to remain the leader as long as you can especially in the last trick. as being the leader in the first to 3 trick doesn't mean you can be the leader in the final trick

# At the end of each trick the leader or winner of the trick (The one with the highest ranked card of leading suit) is allowed to played first in the next trick.

# if in a particular trick someone plays a higher card of the leading suit than that of the leader, that particular player becomes the leader for that trick and the rest of the game until someone plays a higher card of the suit the leader plays.

# In the final trick the person who leads or win the trick wins the game.

# Winning is awared by the following rules. 1. if the last card of the final trick which is the leading suit is has a rank other than a 6 and  a 7 its scored one.   2. if the last card has a rank of 7 its scored two. if the last card is has a rank of 6 its scored 3.

# Lower ranked cards like 5 and below are not played in spa.

# All cards ranked 6 may also not be allowed in the game depending on mutual consent.

# The winner of the final trick becomes the shuffler for the next round
